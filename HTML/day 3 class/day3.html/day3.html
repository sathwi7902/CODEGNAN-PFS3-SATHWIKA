        <h2>Hunter 350</h2>
        <pre>
The Hunter 350 is one good looking motorcycle. It gets an engine that churns out good performance but its stiff ride quality makes it  
little bothersome. In terms of features, the Hunter gets the basic ones and misses out the GPS. But its high aspirational value and 
accessible seat height definitely makes it enticing.
